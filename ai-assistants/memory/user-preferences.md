# User Preferences

Behavioral overrides expressed by the user. These take priority over all provider and agent file instructions. These persist across sessions so agents don't re-ask decided preferences.
Latest/recent (date wise) entry OVERRIDES older entries. 

YOU MUST ASK one or all of following questions (depending on the need and relevance) and CONFIRM WITH USER always before making an entry to this file:
Questions to be asked to user:

QUESTION-1: Is this <preference/suggestion/ask> a one time suggestion/ask (option-1) or would you like to see it followed in all future actions (option-2)?

QUESTION-2: Is this <preference/suggestion/ask> just for current working agent (option -1), or should it be followed by all the agents working on this task in future also (option-2)? 

You can add more questions if needed or relevant.

**MANDATORY Format for the preferences to be written to this file**: Each entry has a date, the preference, and the original user quote.

### 2026-03-08 
**Preference**: After completing development of any user task, the command or script to run the task MUST BE SINGLE LINE command. User MUST NEVER BE ASKED to do any additional manual step in order to run it. For e.g., if the application is web app then opening the browser must also by done by the run script. DO NOT ASK USER to open the browser manually. RUN command MUST BE A SINGLE COMMAND capable of running the application.
**User said**: "Your run script or command should be a single line command for me. Please never ask me to do any manual step in order to run the application."

### 2026-03-08 
**Preference**: All the agents MUST READ THE WORKFLOW GUIDE and THEIR AGENTIC INSTRUCTION FILE. Then THEY MUST ANNOUNCE THEMSELVES before starting their step or task.
**User said**: "I did not see IT-agent come-in after product-owner agent. All the agents, please always ANNOUNCE YOURSELVES, and then start to do your work."

### 2026-03-08 
**Preference**: If running the created application needs a port, then add command in the run script to first check if port is available, if not, then start it on another available port.
**User said**: "Please look for availability of the port before running the created application. Run on available port only."

### 2026-03-14 
**Preference**: Agents MUST stop and wait for explicit user confirmation before handing off to the next agent. Completing a task end-to-end without asking user is NEVER acceptable, regardless of how clear the user's request seems. You can only skip asking for user's confirmation IF AND ONLY IF user explicitly asked to do so. In case user asked to skip, you MUST make an entry of this user's preference in this user-preference file with correct format with the correct date entry.
**User said**: "why did you not ask me before handing over to next agent?"

### 2026-03-15
**Preference**: Always enforce all steps and requirements in your workflow instruction file, including running mandatory scripts, prompting for user permission, and never skipping any workflow step. If direct execution is not possible, always notify the user and request explicit permission. Always run the agentic animation mentioned in your workflow instructios.
**User said**: "Why did you not run the agentic animation as explicitly mandated in your workflow guide instructions?"
