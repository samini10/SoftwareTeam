## 1. Overview

The **Automated Multi-Agent Peer Review System** uses LLM APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Azure, Cohere, or Mistral) to automatically review pull requests as different agent roles in a single sequential workflow.

### Key Features

✅ **Fully Automated**: No manual review needed - agents review automatically
✅ **Sequential Reviews**: Product Owner → Architect → Tester (or Developer) review one after another
✅ **Intelligent Feedback**: Each agent applies their expertise and detailed checklist
✅ **Inline Comments**: Issues appear directly on specific lines in "Files changed" tab
✅ **Approval Tracking**: Automatically tracks approvals and marks PR when threshold met
✅ **Iteration Support**: Reviewers re-review after Developer pushes changes
✅ **Single Session**: All reviews happen in one workflow run

### Benefits

- **Quality Assurance**: Multiple expert perspectives on every PR
- **Consistency**: Same rigorous standards applied every time
- **Speed**: Automated reviews complete in minutes
- **Precision**: Inline comments point to exact lines of code with issues
- **Learning**: Detailed feedback helps improve code quality
- **Transparency**: All review comments visible in PR (Conversation + Files changed tabs)
- **Flexible**: Choose from 6 LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Azure, Cohere, Mistral)

## 2. How It Works
> **Note:** Manual trigger is recommended to save LLM API costs, especially for large or frequent PRs. Automatic triggers may result in higher API usage and costs.
#### How to Change PR review Trigger Configuration from automtatic to manual

By default, the workflow runs automatically on PRs to <code>master_*</code> branches and can also be triggered manually from the Actions tab.

**To make the workflow manual trigger only (disable automatic runs on PR events):**
1. Open <code>.github/workflows/automated-peer-review.yml</code> in your repository.
2. Remove or comment out the <code>pull_request</code> section under <code>on:</code> so only <code>workflow_dispatch</code> remains, like this:
   ```yaml
   on:
     workflow_dispatch:
       inputs:
         pr_number:
           description: 'PR number to review'
           required: true
           type: number
   ```
3. Commit and push the change. Now, the workflow will only run when manually triggered from the Actions tab.

### Workflow Triggers

The automated review workflow runs automatically when a pull request is opened, updated (new commits pushed), or reopened targeting any branch matching <code>master_*</code>. It can also be triggered manually from the Actions tab ("Run workflow") by entering a PR number. Both methods are supported by default.

### Review and Rework Cycle

1. When a PR is opened or updated, agents review it in sequence.
2. If any agent requests changes, the developer must push new commits to address the feedback.
3. On new commits, the workflow is triggered again, and agents who previously requested changes enter **re-review mode**: they check only if their previous concerns are addressed.
4. If all concerns are resolved, agents approve the PR. If not, they request changes again.
5. **Critical: Only one rework cycle is allowed per agent (to save API cost).**
  - If an agent requests changes again after the first rework, the next re-review is a **MANDATORY APPROVAL**: the agent must approve, even if some issues remain, and can only leave remarks as inline comments. This prevents endless rework cycles, controls API usage, and ensures the process always terminates.
6. This cycle repeats for each agent until all required approvals are obtained and the PR can be merged.
7. If the PR is closed (without merging), the review cycle ends and no further reviews are performed.

**To trigger the review manually:**
1. Go to the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository
2. Click **"Automated Multi-Agent Peer Review"** in the left sidebar
3. Click the **"Run workflow"** button (top right)
4. Enter the **PR number** in the input field
5. Click the green **"Run workflow"** button to start
6. Wait 1-3 minutes for reviews to appear as PR comments

## 3. Review Flow

### Phase 1: Initial Review (After PR Created)

1. **Developer** creates PR from `agent/developer-rtdcs-pbCFa`
2. **User triggers** the review workflow from the Actions tab (enter PR number)
3. **Product Owner Agent** reviews:
   - Fetches PR diff and files
   - Calls LLM API with Product Owner prompt and checklist
   - LLM analyzes code for standards, patterns, documentation
   - Posts review comment: "✅ APPROVED" or "🔴 CHANGES REQUESTED"
4. **Architect Agent** reviews:
   - Calls LLM API with Architect prompt and checklist
   - LLM checks design adherence, SOLID principles, interfaces
   - Posts review comment with decision
5. **Tester Agent** reviews:
   - Calls LLM API with Tester prompt and checklist
   - LLM evaluates testability, coverage, quality gates
   - Posts review comment with decision
6. **Approval Check**:
   - Count approvals (✅ APPROVED markers in comments)
   - If ≥ 2 approvals: Add labels `peer-review:approved`, `ready-for-user-review`
   - If changes requested: Add label `peer-review:changes-requested`

### Phase 2: Iteration (After Changes)

1. **Developer** addresses feedback and pushes new commits
2. **User re-triggers** the review workflow from the Actions tab (same PR number)
3. **All reviewers re-review** the updated code (sequential again)
4. **Approval re-check**: Count fresh approvals
5. **Repeat** until PR is approved or closed

---

## 5. Setup Requirements

### 5.1 Repository Secrets

**Required**:
- `LLM_API_KEY`: Your Anthropic/Claude API key
  - Obtain from: https://console.anthropic.com/
  - Add to: Repository Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret
  - Name: `LLM_API_KEY`
  - Value: `sk-ant-...`

**Automatic**:
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Automatically provided by GitHub Actions (no setup needed)

### 5.2 GitHub Actions Permissions

Ensure GitHub Actions has write permissions:

1. Go to: Repository Settings → Actions → General
2. Scroll to "Workflow permissions"
3. Select: "Read and write permissions"
4. Check: "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"
5. Save

### 5.3 Install Workflow Files

```bash
# Workflows already in .github/workflows/
# - pr-review-assignment.yml (labels and checklist comment)
# - automated-peer-review.yml (automated reviews)

# Review script already in .github/scripts/
# - automated-review.js (orchestrates reviews)
# - providers/*.js (LLM provider modules)
# - package.json (dependencies)
```

### 5.4 First-Time Setup

After merging this PR:

1. **Add LLM_PROVIDER and LLM_API_KEY secrets** (see 5.1 above)
2. **Verify GitHub Actions permissions** (see 5.2 above)
3. **Test with a sample PR**:
   ```bash
   # Create a test PR from a agent/developer-test-xxxxx branch
   # Watch workflow run in Actions tab
   # Check PR comments for agent reviews
   ```

---

## 6. Approval Thresholds

### Current Configuration

- **Required Approvals**: 2 (configurable in workflow)
- **Approval Triggers**: When 2+ agents post "✅ APPROVED"
- **Labels Added**: `peer-review:approved`, `ready-for-user-review`
- **Awaiting Labels**: Removed when approved

### Decision Logic

```javascript
if (approvals >= 2 && changesRequested === 0) {
  // Mark as peer-review approved
  // Add "ready-for-user-review" label
  // Remove "awaiting-*-review" labels
  // Post approval summary comment
} else if (changesRequested > 0) {
  // Add "peer-review:changes-requested" label
  // Developer needs to fix and push
} else {
  // Still waiting for more approvals
}
```

### Examples

**Scenario 1**: All 3 reviewers approve
- Approvals: 3/2 ✅
- Result: **APPROVED**, ready for user review

**Scenario 2**: 2 approve, 1 requests changes
- Approvals: 2/2
- Changes Requested: 1
- Result: **CHANGES REQUESTED**, Developer must fix

**Scenario 3**: Only 1 approves so far
- Approvals: 1/2
- Result: **WAITING**, need 1 more approval

---

## 7. Review Iteration Cycle

### Iteration Example

**Round 1**:
1. Developer creates PR
2. Product Owner: 🔴 CHANGES REQUESTED (naming issues)
3. Architect: 🔴 CHANGES REQUESTED (SOLID violation)
4. Tester: ✅ APPROVED (tests are good)
5. **Result**: Changes requested (2 agents requested changes)

**Developer Actions**:
- Fixes naming issues
- Refactors to follow SOLID principles
- Commits: `git commit -m "Fix: Apply SOLID principles and improve naming"`
- Pushes: `git push`

**Round 2** (user re-triggers workflow from Actions tab):
1. Product Owner: ✅ APPROVED (naming fixed)
2. Architect: ✅ APPROVED (SOLID principles now correct)
3. Tester: ✅ APPROVED (tests still good)
4. **Result**: 3/2 approvals → **APPROVED** ✅

**User Review**:
- User sees PR with 3 agent approvals
- User reviews and merges

## 9. Troubleshooting

### Issue: No Reviews After PR Creation

**Symptoms**: PR created but no automated reviews appear

**Most Likely Cause**: The workflow is **manual trigger only** — it does NOT run automatically.

**Solution**:
1. Go to the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository
2. Click **"Automated Multi-Agent Peer Review"** in the left sidebar
3. Click **"Run workflow"**, enter the PR number, and click the green button
4. Wait 1-3 minutes for reviews to appear

**Other Possible Causes**:
1. Branch name doesn't match pattern `{llm-name}/{agent}-{project}-{sessionID}`
2. GitHub Actions disabled in repository settings
3. `LLM_API_KEY` secret not configured

### Issue: API Key Error

**Symptoms**: Workflow fails with "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable is required"

**Solution**:
1. Add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` secret to repository:
   - Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret
2. Ensure secret name is exactly `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
3. Re-run workflow

### Issue: Reviews Not Posting

**Symptoms**: Workflow runs but no review comments appear on PR

**Possible Causes**:
1. GitHub token permissions insufficient
2. Script error parsing PR details
3. LLM API rate limit hit

**Solutions**:
- Check workflow permissions (read and write needed)
- Check Actions logs for errors
- Wait a few minutes if rate limited

### Issue: Wrong Number of Reviewers

**Symptoms**: Expected 3 reviewers but only 2 reviewed

**Cause**: Review assignment rules based on branch pattern

**Solution**: Verify branch name matches pattern and agent type is correct

### Issue: Approval Not Marked

**Symptoms**: 2+ agents approved but PR not marked as approved

**Possible Causes**:
1. Some reviews still have "CHANGES REQUESTED"
2. Review comments don't contain exact approval markers
3. Label creation failed

**Solutions**:
- Check that changes requested count is 0
- Verify review comments contain "✅ **APPROVED**" exactly
- Manually add labels if needed

## Appendix A: LLM Provider Configuration

### Supported Providers

| Provider | Model | Best For | Cost |
|----------|-------|----------|------|
| OpenAI | GPT-4o | General purpose | $$ |
| Anthropic | Claude Sonnet 4 | Code review | $$$ |
| Gemini | Gemini Pro | Fast responses | $ |
| Azure | GPT-4 | Enterprise | $$$ |
| Cohere | Command R Plus | Efficiency | $ |
| Mistral | Mistral Large | Open-source | $ |

### Modular Architecture

The system uses a modular provider architecture:
- Each provider in separate file: `.github/scripts/providers/{provider}.js`
- Dynamic loading based on `LLM_PROVIDER` environment variable
- Standardized interface: `callLLM(prompt, agentType)` returns review text
- Easy to add new providers without modifying main script

### Switching Providers

To switch providers, just update GitHub Secrets:
1. Settings → Secrets → Actions
2. Update `LLM_PROVIDER` to new provider name
3. Update `LLM_API_KEY` to new provider's key
4. (Optional) Add provider-specific secrets like `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`

No code changes required!

### Model Configuration

Models vary by provider:
- **OpenAI**: `gpt-4o`
- **Anthropic**: `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`
- **Gemini**: `gemini-pro`
- **Azure**: `gpt-4`
- **Cohere**: `command-r-plus`
- **Mistral**: `mistral-large-latest`

**Common Settings**:
- **Max Tokens**: 4096
- **Temperature**: 0.2 (lower for consistent reviews)

### Cost Considerations

**Per Review**:
- Input: ~2000-5000 tokens (PR details + prompt)
- Output: ~500-2000 tokens (review comment)
- Cost: ~$0.01-$0.05 per review

**Per PR** (3 reviewers):
- Total: ~$0.03-$0.15 per PR

**Monthly** (assuming 50 PRs/month):
- Total: ~$1.50-$7.50/month

*Note: Costs are approximate and depend on PR size and LLM provider pricing*
