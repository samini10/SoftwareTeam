# Setup Wizard - Engineering Product Specification (EPS)

## 1. Product Overview

**Product Name:** Setup Wizard for AI-Assisted Development Workflow

**Version:** 1.0

**Date:** 2026-02-07

**Summary:** A browser-based setup wizard that enables non-programmers to set up and configure the AI-assisted agentic development workflow with a single command. The wizard eliminates the need for users to understand terminals, git, package managers, or configuration files.

## 2. Product Vision

### 2.1 Problem

The existing `QUICK-START.md` setup process requires 15+ manual steps involving terminal commands, GitHub UI navigation, environment variable exports, and package manager operations. This is a significant barrier for non-technical users who want to leverage AI-assisted development.

### 2.2 Solution

A single-command setup that opens a browser-based wizard with step-by-step visual guidance. The wizard handles all installations, configurations, and file operations behind the scenes while presenting a friendly UI.

### 2.3 Success Criteria

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Steps for non-programmer to complete setup | 1 terminal command + follow wizard screens |
| Technical knowledge required | Ability to open Terminal/PowerShell and paste a command |
| Supported operating systems | macOS 12+, Ubuntu 20.04+, Fedora 36+, Windows 10+ |
| External dependencies required | Python 3 (auto-installed if missing) |
| Time to complete setup | Under 10 minutes |

## 5. Product Features

### 5.1 Feature: One-Command Bootstrap

**Description:** Users start the entire setup with a single paste-able command.

| Platform | Command |
|----------|---------|
| Mac/Linux | `curl -sL <url>/setup/setup.sh \| bash` |
| Windows | `irm <url>/setup/setup.ps1 \| iex` |

**What happens:**
1. Script downloads itself and the project tarball/zip
2. Installs Python 3 if missing
3. Launches the wizard in the browser
4. Cleans up temp files when done

**User prerequisite:** Ability to open Terminal (Mac/Linux) or PowerShell (Windows) and paste a command.

### 5.2 Feature: Dual Workflow Modes

**Description:** Users choose between GitHub-integrated or fully-local workflow.

| Mode | Screens Shown | Git Required | GitHub Account Required | Internet After Setup |
|------|--------------|-------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| GitHub | All 9 | Yes | Yes | Yes (for PRs, reviews) |
| Local | 5 of 9 | No | No | No |

**Skip logic:** Local mode automatically skips screens 3 (GitHub Account), 4 (Token), 5 (Fork/Clone), and 6 (LLM Provider).

### 5.3 Feature: Guided GitHub Setup

**Description:** Step-by-step visual guidance for GitHub account creation, sign-in, and token generation.

**Sub-features:**

| Claude Code | CLI | `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` | `CLAUDE.md` |
| VS Code + Continue | GUI IDE + Extension | `brew install --cask visual-studio-code` | `.continuerules` |
| VS Code + Copilot | GUI IDE + Extension | `brew install --cask visual-studio-code` | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` |
| Aider | CLI | `pip3 install aider-chat` | `.aider.conf.yml` |

**Post-install:** Tool is launched pointed at the project directory, where it automatically picks up its instruction file.

### 5.6 Feature: Verification and Fallback

**Description:** Three-layer approach to confirm the AI tool is connected to the workflow.

| Layer | What It Does |
|-------|-------------|
| 1. Precondition | Wizard ensures instruction file exists at expected path |
| 2. Verification prompt | User pastes "What is the first agent role you adopt for any task?" — expected: "Product Owner" |
| 3. Fallback prompt | If verification fails, user pastes a per-tool prompt that explicitly tells the AI to read its instruction file |

## 6. Platform and Environment Support

### 6.1 Operating Systems

| OS | Minimum Version | Package Manager | Entry Script |
|----|----------------|----------------|-------------|
| macOS | 12 (Monterey) | Homebrew (auto-installed) | `setup.sh` |

## 7. User Interface Specification

### 7.1 Layout

- Max width: 680px, centered
- Background: light gray (`#f8fafc`)
- Cards: white with subtle shadow and border
- Font: System font stack (`-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, sans-serif`)
- Responsive: works down to 320px width

### 7.2 Progress Indicator

Segmented horizontal bar at top of wizard. Each segment represents one screen:
- **Gray:** Not yet reached
- **Blue:** Current screen
- **Green:** Completed screen

### 7.3 Screen Template

Each screen follows this structure:
1. **Title** (h2)
2. **Description** (muted text, 1-2 sentences)
3. **Content area** (varies per screen: radio groups, status lists, input fields, tool grids)
4. **Button row** (Back on left, Next on right; Next disabled until step is complete)

### 7.4 Interactive Components

| Component | Usage |
|-----------|-------|
| Radio options | Workflow mode, LLM provider selection (clickable cards with radio buttons) |
| Status items | Prerequisite check (icon + label + version + action button) |
| Tool grid | AI tool selection (2-column grid of clickable cards) |
| Copy box | Verification/fallback prompts (dark box with text + Copy button) |
| Instructions | Step-by-step guides (numbered list with links and code highlights) |
| Alerts | Feedback messages (info blue, success green, warning amber, danger red) |
| Input fields | Token input, API key input, path input, project name input |

## 8. Data Flow

### 8.1 Token and API Key Handling

```
User pastes token in wizard UI (browser)
  -> JavaScript sends POST /api/github/token {"token": "ghp_..."}
  -> Python saves to shell profile (~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc) or Windows user env
  -> Python runs: echo "token" | gh auth login --with-token
  -> Response: {"success": true}
```

Tokens and API keys:
- Are stored **only on the user's local machine**
- Are transmitted only over `127.0.0.1` (localhost, never over the network)
- Are saved to the user's shell profile (Mac/Linux) or user environment variables (Windows)
- Are optionally saved as GitHub repository secrets (via `gh secret set`)

### 8.2 Fork and Clone Flow

```
User clicks "Fork & Clone" in wizard UI
  -> POST /api/github/fork-clone {"path": "/Users/me/Desktop", "project_name": "my-project"}
  -> Python runs: gh repo fork meenusinha/SoftwareTeam --clone=false
  -> Python runs: gh repo clone SoftwareTeam "/Users/me/Desktop/my-project" -- --branch main
  -> Response: {"success": true, "project_path": "/Users/me/Desktop/my-project"}
```

### 8.3 Local Copy Flow

```
User clicks "Copy Project Files" in wizard UI
  -> POST /api/local/copy {"path": "/Users/me/Desktop", "project_name": "my-project"}
  -> Python runs: shutil.copytree(source, dest, ignore='.git')
  -> Source = WIZARD_REPO_PATH env var (set by setup.sh, points to extracted tarball)
  -> Response: {"success": true, "project_path": "/Users/me/Desktop/my-project"}
```

## 9. Constraints and Limitations

| Constraint | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| No native folder picker | Browser security prevents accessing a native OS folder picker from a web page. Users select from suggested paths or type a custom path. |
| Cannot verify AI tool loaded instructions | No AI tool exposes an API to confirm it read its config file. Mitigated by the verification prompt approach. |
| Sudo on Linux | Package installation requires sudo. If the user doesn't have sudo access, auto-install fails and manual instructions are shown. |
| curl pipe to bash | The entry point uses `curl | bash`, which some security-conscious users may distrust. They can download and inspect the script first. |
| Python on Windows | Python is not pre-installed on Windows. The setup script installs it via winget or downloads the installer directly. |
| Single AI tool | The wizard installs and configures one AI tool at a time. Users can re-run the wizard to set up additional tools. |

## 10. Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|------------|
| Homebrew installation fails (macOS) | Cannot install git, gh, or tools | Low | Provide manual install links; xcode-select as git fallback |
| User doesn't have sudo (Linux) | Package installation fails | Medium | Show clear error message with manual instructions |
| GitHub OAuth flow fails | Cannot sign in | Low | Allow manual token paste as alternative |
| API key page UI changes | Screenshots/instructions become outdated | Medium | Use text-only instructions (no screenshots); link directly to key page |
| Python version incompatibility | Wizard doesn't start | Low | Require Python 3.7+; use only stable standard library modules |
| winget not available (older Windows) | Cannot auto-install tools | Medium | Fallback to direct installer downloads or chocolatey |
