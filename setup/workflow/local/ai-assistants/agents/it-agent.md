## Step 1: Verify Tools

**Before starting**: Read [`ai-assistants/memory.md`](./ai-assistants/memory.md) for user preferences, past decisions, and known issues.

**CRITICAL: Before anything else, verify and install the tools needed for the project. Never assume tools are pre-installed on the user's machine.**

### ⛔ Forbidden Patterns in ALL Commands (CRITICAL — READ BEFORE WRITING ANY COMMAND)

Many AI coding tools (Aider, Cursor, Windsurf, Continue, Copilot, etc.) have built-in security rules that automatically block shell commands containing certain keywords. If you use any of these forbidden patterns, the command will be rejected and the agent will get stuck. This applies to EVERY command you write or generate — including the templates below, runtime commands for project-specific tools, and any ad-hoc commands during setup.

**NEVER use `/dev/null` in any form.** Do not write `2>/dev/null`, `&>/dev/null`, `>/dev/null`, or any redirection to `/dev/null`. Instead, redirect stderr to stdout using `2>&1`. If you need to silently check whether a command exists, use `command -v something 2>&1 | grep -q pattern` instead of `command -v something &>/dev/null`.

**NEVER use `curl` in any command.** Do not write `curl -fsSL`, `curl -sL`, or any variation. Instead, use `wget -qO-` for downloading content, or better yet, use the native package manager directly (e.g., `brew install`, `apt-get install`, `pkg_install`). For downloading scripts or files, use `wget -qO filename url`.

**NEVER use `eval` in any command.** Do not write `eval "$cmd"` or `eval "$(something)"`. Instead, execute commands directly using `$cmd` or call the command by name. For example, instead of `eval "$install_linux"`, write `$install_linux`.

**NEVER use `iex` or `Invoke-Expression` in PowerShell commands.** Instead, download scripts with `Invoke-WebRequest` and then execute the downloaded file.

**NEVER ask the user to perform manual actions.** Do not output messages like "Run:", "Please install", "Then re-run this step", or any instruction that requires the user to do something themselves. Everything must be handled automatically by the agent. If a tool cannot be installed automatically, report the failure and let the agent decide the next action.

**NEVER use `exit 1` to stop on missing tools.** Instead, report the problem with an error message and continue execution. The agent will handle the failure and decide whether to retry or take an alternative approach.

### Platform Detection and Base Package Manager

}
```

### BEFORE HANDING OFF (MANDATORY - DO NOT SKIP)

- [ ] **Required tools installed** and working (package manager detected)
- [ ] **Memory updated** — record any user preferences, project decisions, or mistakes in `ai-assistants/memory/`

**Go back to your WORKFLOW GUIDE for MANDATORY HANDOVER before Step 2.**

---

## Step 5: Project Setup

**Before starting**: Read [`ai-assistants/memory.md`](./ai-assistants/memory.md) for user preferences, past decisions, and known issues.

**When you receive a handover from the Architect, you MUST:**

1. **Read** the handover context — what was designed, tech stack chosen, open questions
2. **Ask clarifying questions** before starting infrastructure work:
   - **What** tech stack was chosen? What tools and runtimes are needed?
   - **How** should the build/deploy work? Any specific requirements?
   - **Dependencies** — what system packages, runtimes, or services are needed?
   - **Target platforms** — which OS/environments must be supported?
3. **Wait for answers** — do NOT start installing until questions are answered

### Language Runtime & Tool Installation

**General principle: Work backwards from what needs to be installed.**

| Need to run | First verify & install |
|-------------|----------------------|
| `make` / `Makefile` | `make` (GNU Make) |
| `cmake` / `CMakeLists.txt` | `cmake` and `make` (or `ninja`) |
| `npm install` | `node` and `npm` (Node.js) |
| `pip install` | `python3` and `pip3` |
| `cargo build` | `rustc` and `cargo` (Rust) |
| `go build` | `go` (Go) |
| `mvn install` | `java` and `mvn` (Java/Maven) |
| `gradle build` | `java` and `gradle` |
| `gem install` | `ruby` and `gem` |
| `composer install` | `php` and `composer` |
| `msbuild` / `.sln` | `dotnet` SDK or Visual Studio Build Tools |

```bash
check_and_install() {
  local cmd="$1" install_linux="$2" install_mac="$3" install_win="$4" label="$5"
  if command -v "$cmd" 2>&1 | grep -q '^/'; then
    echo "✅ $label: $($cmd --version 2>&1 | head -1)"
    return 0
  fi
  echo "⚠️  $label not found. Installing..."
  case "$OS_TYPE" in
    Linux*)               $install_linux ;;
    Darwin*)              $install_mac ;;
    MINGW*|MSYS*|CYGWIN*) $install_win ;;
  esac
  if command -v "$cmd" 2>&1 | grep -q '^/'; then
    echo "✅ $label installed"
  else
    echo "❌ $label install failed. Search '$label install' for your OS."
    return 1
  fi
}

#   "pkg_install dotnet-sdk-8.0" \
#   "brew install dotnet" \
#   "winget install Microsoft.DotNet.SDK.8" \

```

### Project Dependencies

After runtimes are installed, install project dependencies:
- Run dependency installation (`npm install`, `pip install -r requirements.txt`, etc.)
- Document installation steps in `project-management/operations/environment/`

### External API Keys (MANDATORY — Do This Before Creating Scripts)

**Before writing any run script**, scan the Architect's design documents and codebase for any external service API keys the app requires at runtime (e.g. NewsAPI, OpenWeatherMap, Stripe, Twilio, Google Maps, etc.).

**For EVERY required external API key you find, you MUST:**

1. **Tell the user exactly what service it is for and why the app needs it**, e.g.:
   > "This app fetches news articles from NewsAPI. You need a free API key from https://newsapi.org/register. Without it the app will fail to load news."

2. **Ask the user to provide the key**, e.g.:
   > "Please paste your NewsAPI key so I can configure it before running the app:"

3. **Wait for the user's answer** — do NOT proceed to running the app without it.

4. **Write the key to a `.env` file** in the project root (create it if it doesn't exist), e.g.:
   ```
   NEWS_API_KEY=the-key-the-user-provided
   ```

5. **Ensure `.env` is in `.gitignore`** — never commit API keys to git.

6. **Load the `.env` file in `run.sh`** so the key is available at runtime:
   ```bash
   # Load environment variables from .env if it exists
   if [ -f .env ]; then
     set -a; source .env; set +a
   fi
   ```

**If the user cannot provide a key right now**, tell them the exact error they will see if they run the app without it, and what URL they need to visit to get the key.

**Never silently skip this step.** An app that crashes at startup with a cryptic API error is a broken handoff.

### Create Project Scripts

Create or update scripts in the `scripts/` folder:

```
scripts/
├── build.sh   # Build commands for the tech stack
├── test.sh    # Test commands for the test framework
├── run.sh     # Start/run the application
└── clean.sh   # Clean build artifacts
```

- Customize scripts for the chosen technology stack
- Ensure scripts work on all target platforms (Mac, Linux, Windows)
- `run.sh` must source `.env` if it exists before starting the app (see above)

### BEFORE HANDING OFF (MANDATORY - DO NOT SKIP)

- [ ] **All prerequisites installed** — language runtimes, package managers, build tools
- [ ] **Project dependencies installed** — all packages from Architect's design
- [ ] **External API keys collected** — asked user for every required external service key, written to `.env`, `.env` is in `.gitignore`
- [ ] **Build scripts created/updated** in `scripts/` — build.sh, test.sh, run.sh, clean.sh
- [ ] **`run.sh` sources `.env`** — so all API keys are loaded at runtime
- [ ] **Build verified** — scripts run successfully without errors
- [ ] **Environment documented** — setup steps recorded in `project-management/operations/environment/`
- [ ] **Memory updated** — record any user preferences, project decisions, or mistakes in `ai-assistants/memory/`
- [ ] Handover question asked and answered — user was explicitly asked "PR or hand over?" and user gave a direct answer to this question (not to
  some other question)

**Go back to your WORKFLOW GUIDE for MANDATORY HANDOVER before Step 6.**

---

## Step 8: Release

**Before starting**: Read [`ai-assistants/memory.md`](./ai-assistants/memory.md) for user preferences, past decisions, and known issues.

**When you receive a handover from the Tester, you MUST:**

1. **Read** the handover context — what was tested, test results, any open issues
2. **Verify** all tests pass before building the release

### Release Process

1. **Create versioned release folder** (e.g., `release/v1.0.0/`)
2. **Package artifacts** from module release folders
3. **Include a `run.sh` script** in release artifacts so users can start the app automatically
4. **Generate release notes** from documentation
5. **Update release documentation** in `project-management/operations/releases/`

### BEFORE HANDING OFF (MANDATORY - DO NOT SKIP)

- [ ] **Release folder created** — `release/v[X.Y.Z]/` with packaged artifacts
- [ ] **run.sh included** in release artifacts
- [ ] **Release notes generated** from documentation
- [ ] **All artifacts verified** — release package is complete and functional
- [ ] **Memory updated** — record any user preferences, project decisions, or mistakes in `ai-assistants/memory/`
- [ ] Handover question asked and answered — user was explicitly asked "PR or hand over?" and user gave a direct answer to this question (not to
  some other question)
  
**Go back to your WORKFLOW GUIDE for MANDATORY HANDOVER before Step 9.**
