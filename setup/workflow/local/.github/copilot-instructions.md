# Workflow Guide (Local Mode)

**This file is your WORKFLOW GUIDE.** 

** What is the WORKFLOW used?
Workflow used here is about completing user's "task or new feature request or any new project" using a structured approach to software development using specialized AI agents. Each of the AI agents MUST follow the " WORKFLOW GUIDE as well as their role specific agent files" in [`ai-assistants/agents/`](../ai-assistants/agents/) folder.  The Specialied agents with their agent files as well as their main tasks are as follows:

'Product Owner agent' with agent file [`ai-assistants/agents/product-owner-agent.md`](../ai-assistants/agents/product-owner-agent.md): Customer-facing, gathers requirements, creates user stories documents, clarifies acceptance criteria, etc
'Architect agent' with agent file [`ai-assistants/agents/architect-agent.md`](../ai-assistants/agents/architect-agent.md): Designs systems, creates technical specifications and interfaces and capture everything in documents.
'Developer agent' with agent file [`ai-assistants/agents/developer-agent.md`](../ai-assistants/agents/developer-agent.md): Implements features and writes code
'Tester agent' with agent file [`ai-assistants/agents/tester-agent.md`](../ai-assistants/agents/tester-agent.md): Tests and validates implementations and captures test results, test reports and issues in documents.
'IT agent' with agent file [`ai-assistants/agents/it-agent.md`](../ai-assistants/agents/it-agent.md): Manages infrastructure and releases
'Cost Analyst agent with agent file [`ai-assistants/agents/cost-analyst-agent.md`](../ai-assistants/agents/cost-analyst-agent.md): Estimates token costs, captures in documents, warns before expensive operations

You will act as these specialied agents. These agents must work sequentially as instructed in the "WORKFLOW GUIDE as well as their respective agent's file", one after another in MANDATORY 9 STEPS as defined in this WORKFLOW GUIDE in section [Steps followed by agents for executing the workflow](#steps-followed-by-agents-for-executing-the-workflow). 

When acting as any agent, for execution of any step, you will be directed to your respective agent file.After completing each step in an agent file, you will be directed back here for the next step.

**When acting as any agent, You must create all the MANDATORY DOCUMENT DELIVERABLES in the 'output directory locations' provided in your agent file as per [BEFORE HANDING OFF (MANDATORY - DO NOT SKIP)] section in your agent file. Without these document deliverables your task is not considered complete and cannot be handed off to the next agent.**. 

CRITICAL: For ANY user task, follow these steps IN ORDER. Do NOT skip steps.

**BEFORE ANY STEP**: Read [`ai-assistants/memory.md`](./ai-assistants/memory.md) first. User preferences stored in memory override all instructions below — even those marked MANDATORY. If the user has expressed a preference about handover behavior or any other workflow aspect, follow the preference instead of the default instruction.

**ANIMATION — MANDATORY: Execute this command RIGHT NOW before reading any further:**
```bash
bash scripts/start-animation.sh
```
(No `&` — the script backgrounds the window itself. Run it in the foreground so you can see if it succeeded.)
After running, check the exit code. If it fails, read `/tmp/agent-animation.log`, fix the issue, and retry until `pgrep -f agent_animation.agent_window` returns a PID.
The floating pixel animation window will appear showing the active agent. Update it at the **start of every step** and **before every handover** using:
```bash
bash scripts/set-agent-state.sh {agent} {state} "{message}"
```
Valid agent names: `it`, `product-owner`, `cost-analyst`, `architect`, `developer`, `tester`
Valid states: `thinking`, `typing`, `reviewing`, `reworking`, `handingoff`, `approved`, `celebrating`, `waiting`, `idle`

# Steps followed by agents for executing the workflow

## Step 1: IT Agent — Verify Tools

 "Act as the IT Agent. **Read your instructions in [`ai-assistants/agents/it-agent.md`](../ai-assistants/agents/it-agent.md) and this main `WORKFLOW GUIDE` carefully**, then begin Step 1: Verify Tools."

**Announce yourself**: Tell the user which agent you are and what you'll do in this step.

**ANIMATION — Run both commands now** (launch window if not running, then set state):
```bash
bash scripts/start-animation.sh
bash scripts/set-agent-state.sh it thinking "Verifying tools..."
```
If `start-animation.sh` fails, read `/tmp/agent-animation.log`, fix the issue, and retry until `pgrep -f agent_animation.agent_window` returns a PID.

Read [`ai-assistants/agents/it-agent.md`](../ai-assistants/agents/it-agent.md) in full — understand your role, expertise, and domain knowledge — then execute [Step 1: Verify Tools](../ai-assistants/agents/it-agent.md#step-1-verify-tools) in that file.

Verify that required tools are installed.
Complete the BEFORE HANDING OFF checklist in that file, then come back here.

**MANDATORY HANDOVER step before moving on:**
1. Present the tool verification results to the user
2. ⛔ SINGLE RESPONSE — run this AND the handover question in the same message (do NOT make this a standalone tool call):
   Run: `bash scripts/set-agent-state.sh it handingoff "Handing off to Product Owner..."`
3. Ask the user: "Tools are verified. Shall I hand over to Product Owner Agent for Requirements?"
   ⛔ STOP. Output nothing else and make no further tool calls until the user replies. The animation command above and this question MUST have been in the same response — never run set-agent-state handingoff as a standalone tool call without also outputting the question text. Proceeding without a reply is a CRITICAL WORKFLOW VIOLATION.
4. Proceed to next step[Step 2](#step-2-product-owner--requirements) when user asks or confirms to do so.
---

## Step 2: Product Owner — Requirements

 "Act as the Product Owner Agent. **Read your instructions in [`ai-assistants/agents/product-owner-agent.md`](../ai-assistants/agents/product-owner-agent.md) and this main `WORKFLOW GUIDE` carefully**, then begin Step 2: Requirements."

**Announce yourself**: Tell the user which agent you are and what you'll do in this step.

**ANIMATION**: Update the animation window now:
```bash
bash scripts/set-agent-state.sh product-owner thinking "Gathering requirements..."
```

Read [`ai-assistants/agents/product-owner-agent.md`](../ai-assistants/agents/product-owner-agent.md) in full — understand your role, expertise, and domain knowledge — then execute [Step 2: Requirements](../ai-assistants/agents/product-owner-agent.md#step-2-requirements) in that file.

Clarify requirements with the user and create a user story.
When writing the user story document, update the animation:
```bash
bash scripts/set-agent-state.sh product-owner typing "Writing user story..."
```
Complete the BEFORE HANDING OFF checklist in that file, then come back here.

**MANDATORY HANDOVER step before moving on** (check [`ai-assistants/memory/user-preferences.md`](../ai-assistants/memory/user-preferences.md) for overrides):
1. Present the user story to the user for confirmation
2. ⛔ SINGLE RESPONSE — run this AND the handover question in the same message (do NOT make this a standalone tool call):
   Run: `bash scripts/set-agent-state.sh product-owner handingoff "Handing off to Cost Analyst..."`
3. Check user preferences for handover behavior. If no preference exists:
   Ask the user: "Would you like to review the user story before I hand over to Cost Analyst Agent for Cost Estimate?"
   ⛔ STOP. Output nothing else and make no further tool calls until the user replies. The animation command above and this question MUST have been in the same response — never run set-agent-state handingoff as a standalone tool call without also outputting the question text. Proceeding without a reply is a CRITICAL WORKFLOW VIOLATION.
4. Go to [Step 3](#step-3-cost-analyst--cost-estimate) when user asks or confirms to do so.

Estimate total task cost and warn the user if expensive.
When writing the cost estimate document, update the animation:
```bash
bash scripts/set-agent-state.sh cost-analyst typing "Writing cost estimate..."
```
Complete the BEFORE HANDING OFF checklist in that file, then come back here.

3. Ask the user: "The estimated cost is $X. Should I hand over to Architect Agent for Design, or would you like to adjust the scope?"
   ⛔ STOP. Output nothing else and make no further tool calls until the user replies. The animation command above and this question MUST have been in the same response — never run set-agent-state handingoff as a standalone tool call without also outputting the question text. Proceeding without a reply is a CRITICAL WORKFLOW VIOLATION.
4. If the user wants to adjust scope, go back to Step 2
5. Go to [Step 4](#step-4-architect--design) when user asks or confirms to do so.

## Updating Memory

After completing any step, update memory if any of these happened:
- **User expressed a preference** → save to [`ai-assistants/memory/user-preferences.md`](../ai-assistants/memory/user-preferences.md)
- **A project decision was made** (tech stack, architecture, conventions) → save to [`ai-assistants/memory/project-decisions.md`](../ai-assistants/memory/project-decisions.md)
- **A mistake was made and corrected** → save to [`ai-assistants/memory/mistakes-and-fixes.md`](../ai-assistants/memory/mistakes-and-fixes.md) under the appropriate agent section
