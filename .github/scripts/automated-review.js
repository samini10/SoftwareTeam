 *
 * Usage:
 *   node automated-review.js \
 *     --agent <agent-type> \
 *     --pr-number <number> \
 *     --repo <owner/repo> \
 *     --pr-details-file <path>
 *
 * Environment variables:
 *   LLM_PROVIDER - Provider name: openai, anthropic, gemini, azure, cohere, mistral (default: openai)
 *   LLM_API_KEY - API key for your LLM provider
 *   AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT - Required for Azure OpenAI (e.g., https://your-resource.openai.azure.com)
 *   GITHUB_TOKEN - Required for GitHub API
 *
 * Supported LLM Providers:
 *   - openai: OpenAI GPT-4o (default)
 *   - anthropic/claude: Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4

## Pull Request Details

**Title**: ${prDetails.title}

**Description**:
${prDetails.body}

## 🔄 REWORK RE-REVIEW MODE

The developer has reworked this PR to address your previous review. **This is the final review pass — no further rework will be requested.**

**Your Previous Review** (${previousReview.state}):
${previousReview.comments.length > 0 ? previousReview.comments.map((c, i) => `
${i + 1}. **${c.path}:${c.line}**
   ${c.body.replace(/\*\*🤖.*?\*\*\n\n/, '')}
`).join('\n') : '(No inline comments in previous review)'}

**Your Task**:
1. Check each of your previous concerns against the new commits
2. For each: note whether it was RESOLVED or still present (remarks only — no blocking)
3. Add any new observations as inline remarks (optional, informational only)
4. End with a mandatory approval — this is the final pass

**Required Response Format**:

### Rework Assessment
[1-2 sentences: overall assessment of how well the rework addressed your concerns]

### Previous Issues Status
${previousReview.comments.map((c, i) => `Issue #${i + 1} (${c.path}:${c.line}):
- Status: ✅ RESOLVED / ⚠️ PARTIALLY ADDRESSED / ❌ STILL PRESENT (remark only — not blocking)
- Verification: [how you verified it / what remains]`).join('\n\n')}

### Rework Remarks
[Any new inline comments as observations on the rework — format same as below. Write "None" if no remarks.]

INLINE_COMMENT: path/to/file.ext:123
**[Severity: Minor]** [Observation title]
[Brief note — informational, not blocking]

### Decision
[You MUST write this exact line — no other option:]
✅ **APPROVED** - Rework reviewed. [1 sentence summary: e.g. "Critical issues were addressed." / "Some concerns remain but approval is granted for this pass."]

` : previousReview ? `
## 🔄 RE-REVIEW MODE

**IMPORTANT**: You have previously reviewed this PR and requested changes. The developer has pushed new commits to address your feedback.

**Your Previous Review** (${previousReview.state}):
${previousReview.comments.length > 0 ? previousReview.comments.map((c, i) => `
${i + 1}. **${c.path}:${c.line}**
   ${c.body.replace(/\*\*🤖.*?\*\*\n\n/, '')}
`).join('\n') : '(No inline comments in previous review)'}

**Your Task for Re-Review**:
1. Check if the new commits address each of your previous concerns
2. For each previous comment:
   - If ADDRESSED: Mark as resolved (mention "RESOLVED" in response)
   - If NOT ADDRESSED: Explain why and keep requesting changes
3. Do NOT post new comprehensive reviews or new issues
4. Focus ONLY on verifying your previous feedback was addressed

**Response Format for Re-Review**:

### Re-Review Summary
[Brief statement: "All concerns addressed" OR "Some concerns remain"]

### Previous Issues Status
[For each previous issue:]
Issue #1 (${previousReview.comments[0]?.path || 'file'}:${previousReview.comments[0]?.line || 'line'}):
- Status: ✅ RESOLVED / ❌ NOT RESOLVED
- Verification: [How you verified it was fixed / Why it's not fixed]

### Decision
[Write EXACTLY one of these:]
✅ **APPROVED** - All previous concerns have been addressed.
🔴 **CHANGES REQUESTED** - Some concerns remain unaddressed.

` : `
## Your Task

Review this pull request thoroughly using your expertise and the following checklist:`}

## Code Changes

${prDetails.files.map(f => `
### File: ${f.filename}
Status: ${f.status}
Changes: +${f.additions}/-${f.deletions}

`).join('\n')}

${isRework ? `
**IMPORTANT — REWORK REVIEW RULES**:
- Follow the "Required Response Format" above exactly
- Check every previous issue and mark it RESOLVED / PARTIALLY ADDRESSED / STILL PRESENT
- Inline remarks are optional and informational only (Severity: Minor)
- The Decision MUST be ✅ **APPROVED** — no other option is allowed
- Your approval line MUST contain a brief summary sentence after the dash
` : `
**Review Checklist**:
${agent.checklist.map((item, i) => `${i + 1}. ${item}`).join('\n')}

## Review Guidelines

1. **Be thorough**: Check every item on your checklist
2. **Be specific**: Point out exact issues with line numbers/file names
3. **Be constructive**: Provide actionable feedback
4. **Be fair**: Acknowledge good work, but don't lower standards
5. **Focus on your expertise**: Apply your domain knowledge

## CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS

**Comment Prioritization** - Focus ONLY on these critical areas:
1. **Design Issues**: Architecture violations, design pattern misuse, SOLID violations, poor abstractions
2. **Functionality Issues**: Logic errors, incorrect implementations, broken features, edge case failures
3. **Consistency Issues**: Inconsistent with project standards, naming conventions, code style, patterns
4. **Clean Code Issues**: Code smells, hard-to-maintain code, duplication, excessive complexity

**Comment Limit**: Maximum **10 inline comments** per review
- Prioritize the MOST critical issues first
- Focus on issues that have the biggest impact on code quality
- Skip minor formatting or trivial issues if limit is reached
- Every comment must be actionable and important

**Severity Guidelines**:
- **Critical**: Breaks functionality, major design flaw, security issue, violates core principles
- **Major**: Significant code quality issue, maintainability problem, important best practice violation
- **Minor**: Small improvement, stylistic preference, minor inconsistency

## Response Format

Provide your review in this exact format:

### Summary
[1-2 sentences: overall assessment]

### Inline Comments
[Provide MAXIMUM 10 inline comments focusing on the most critical issues]
[Prioritize: Design > Functionality > Consistency > Clean Code]
[Format: Each comment MUST start with "INLINE_COMMENT:" followed by file path and line number]
[If no inline comments, write "None"]

INLINE_COMMENT: path/to/file.ext:123
**[Severity: Critical/Major/Minor]** [Issue title]
[Detailed explanation of the problem and recommendation for fixing it]

[Repeat for each critical issue - MAX 10 COMMENTS TOTAL]

### Positive Aspects
[List good practices observed, or write "None notable" if basic]
- [What was done well]

### Decision
[Write EXACTLY one of these two options:]
✅ **APPROVED** - This PR meets all quality standards for ${agent.role}.
🔴 **CHANGES REQUESTED** - This PR requires changes before approval.

**IMPORTANT**:
- Be strict but fair
- Only approve if ALL checklist items pass
- If there are any Critical or Major issues, you MUST request changes
- Minor issues alone can be approved with suggestions
- Apply SOLID principles and design pattern knowledge rigorously
- For inline comments, always specify the exact file path and line number where the issue exists
- Line numbers should reference the new file content (after changes), not the diff
- **CRITICAL**: Provide MAXIMUM 10 inline comments - prioritize the most impactful issues
- Focus ONLY on: Design, Functionality, Consistency, and Clean Code issues
- Skip minor/trivial issues to stay within the 10-comment limit
